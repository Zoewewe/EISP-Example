## 5.7 Policy Statement

### 5.7.1 Risk Management

This policy is essential for identifying risk and strategies to manage the identified risk. This helps the enterprise as it provides detailed guidance on identifying threats, vulnerabilities and impacts, helps prioritise risks based on likelihood and potential impact and includes methodologies for qualitative and quantitative risk assessments. Risk Management policy encompasses 3 components:

-        Identification: Regular revaluation of asset, identifying vulnerabilities related to that asset and identifying possible threats that may occur.

-        Assessment: Regular risk assessments to evaluate risk and risk impact. This process involves calculating the likelihood and impact of risks while considering the controls in place.

-        Strategies: Regular identification of strategies against identified vulnerabilities while considering the cost of implementation of the strategy.

### 5.7.2 Access Control

This policy is essential for providing security requires implementation to grant, manage and revoke user and system accounts. This helps the enterprise as it requires unique IDs for each person with computer access to ensure accountability, focuses on granting users only the permissions necessary to perform their roles, ensuring authentication for remote access to systems handling cardholder data. This policy will be done by following the components:

-        Unique ID: Random numbers created by hash functions. This ensures that the content of the identified object is truly the objects.

-        Principle of least privilege: The principle means giving any user accounts or processes only those privileges which are essentially vital to perform its intended functions. The principle applies also to a personal computer user who usually does work in a normal user account and opens a privileged, password protected account only when the situation absolutely demands it. 

-        Multi-factor authentication (MFA): This is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism which protects personal data which can be stored in systems.

### 5.7.3 Network Security

This policy ensures that there are security measurements and tools to be in place to protect the network. They help with preventing unauthorised access, detecting potential threats and encrypting traffic to ensure no sending of plain text. This policy will be done by following the components:

-        Firewall: This is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on configurable security rules. This helps with preventing unauthorised users or malicious actors from accessing the organisation’s internal systems and sensitive data

-        Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): This is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations and blocking these malicious activities. This helps with detecting and blocking malicious traffic or activities before they cause harm, providing proactive protection.

-        Transport Layer Security (TLS): Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network, such as the Internet. This helps with encrypting data during transmission to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

### 5.7.4 Data Protection

This policy ensures that there are industry-specific regulations and protecting customer financial data. This helps with reducing the risk of unauthorised access or exposure, staying ahead of evolving threats through continuous monitoring and ensuring consistent compliance and adaptability to new risks through regular policy updates and enforcement. Data Protection policy encompasses 3 components:

-        Protect cardholder data: Encrypt sensitive cardholder data stored in databases, files, or backups using strong encryption algorithms like AES-256. This ensures that there is a lesser chance of there being a risk of unauthorised access or exposure.

-        Testing network: Regular monitoring and testing help organisations stay ahead of evolving threats.

-        Maintain an information security policy: Regular policy communication with stakeholders, policy enforcement by implement mechanisms to enforce the policy and policy updates by regularly review and update the policy to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or business operations.

### 5.7.5 Incident Response

This policy ensures that there is an incident response plan to quickly detect and respond to cyberattacks, minimising downtime and protecting sensitive customer data. This helps with reducing the time it takes to detect and mitigate threats, having a clear understanding of the incident's scope and impact, allowing for targeted and effective containment efforts, minimising the impact on sensitive data and critical systems and enhances future incident response capabilities and strengthens overall data protection.

Incident Response policy encompasses 4 components:

-        Preparation: Ensuring that the organisation is ready to handle security incidents when they occur.

-        Detection and Analysis: Identifying potential security incidents, analysing their scope and impact and determining the appropriate response.

-        The Containment, Eradication and Recovery: Stopping the incident from spreading, removing the threat and restoring affected systems to normal operation.

-        Post-Incident Activity: Reviewing the incident response process, identifying lessons learned and making improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.
